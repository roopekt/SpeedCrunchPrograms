# Memory Game

The player is shown, and then asked an increasingly long number. Has game over logic and point counter.

## Instructions

1. Disable `Settings/Behaviour/Partial Results`
2. Enable `Settings/Behaviour/Complex Numbers`
3. Type in some random digits (the RNG will use this as a seed)
4. Run `g 0`. Memorise the number given to you.
5. Press `Ctrl+N` to clear the console
6. Run `g <The number you memorized>` You will see `<next number to remember>+<points>j` (points may not show up if 0)
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6. If you guess incorrectly, the game will reset automatically.
